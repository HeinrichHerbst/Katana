1.0 Release:
```
 # Katana can now generate 3D process-modelled representations
   of circuit files when given the GDS file, fabrication contours
   and fabrication process information.
 # Katana input paths are specified relative to the application folder.
 # Multiple minor bugfixes and modelling optimization.

```

0.9.4 Release:
```
 # Katana now correctly treats .geo "Surface" as "Plane Surface".
 # Katana's FLOOXS generation module now deposits and etches
   according to the layer thicknesses specified in the LDF file.

```

0.9.3 Release:
```
 # FLOOXS generated scripts now call the Gmsh meshing system instead of Triangle.
 # Katana now properly handles unrolled .geo files
   (.geo Importer understands characteristic length command "cl__1".)
 # Volume calculation now works correctly with meshes generated from Windows Gmsh.

```
0.9.2 Release:
```
 # Added scale functionality to geometry operations.
 # Added support for Mesh spacing argument in geometry files.
```
0.9.1 Release:
```
 # Katana now successfully handles cross-sections submerged in a polygon.
 # Masks will no longer erroneously be generated over entire layer.
```
0.9 Release:
```
    1 - Merge two Gmsh .geo files together
    2 - Simplify .geo files
    3 - Perform coherence optimization on .geo files
    4 - Translate entire .geo file
    5 - Rotate entire .geo file.
    6 - Volume calculation of Gmsh .msh Physical Volumes
